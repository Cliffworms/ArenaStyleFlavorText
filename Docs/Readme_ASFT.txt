==============
1. DESCRIPTION
==============

Arena-Style Flavor Text brings our favorite feature from the Elder Scrolls I Arena : flavor texts upon entering
a public location that describe the overall feeling of the place depending on weather, season, climate, time of
day and building type. 

Patrons laughing upon entering the inn, distant chants in the temples, feelings of tension in palaces, or a shop's
cheery atmosphere on a sunny summer day.

The messages show upon entering a location and the content varies depending, as mentioned, on the weather, season,
climate, time of day and building type. 

At the moment, it affects the following locations : Temples, Taverns, Palaces, Shops and the Mages Guild.

Should someone be interested in writing up the texts for the Fighters Guild and the knightly orders,
that would be more than welcome!


===============
2. INSTALLATION
===============

Make sure you are running Daggerfall Unity 0.11.5 or later. (https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity)

Either install using Vortex Mod Manager or install manually as described below.


Extract the content of the archive to the StreamingAssets of your Daggerfall Unity directory.

Example : [Your drive]\DagUnity\DaggerfallUnity_Data\StreamingAssets

If you already have the "Cliff" folder, you can overwrite without issue.


=============
3. SAVE GAMES
=============

If you are loading Arena-Style Flavor Text on an existing save game, you will need to open Daggerfall Unity's console
and type the following : 

StartQuest ARENAMSGMAIN


The quest controlling the texts will then be initiated.

The key to open the console can be found in the settings, under the "Advanced" tab in "Controls".

4. CONFLICTS/KNOWN ERRORS
=========================

None known. Let Kab the Bird Ranger or Cliffworms know if something's wrong.


=======================
5. FLAVOR TEXT EXAMPLES
=======================

You leave the overcast spring day and
enter (tavern). The smell
of simple baked breads coming from
the kitchen seems like an invitation
to stay.

You walk into the lord's audience chamber, noticing the
many fine trappings and warm furs that decorate the area.
The chill in your bones quickly melts, and you feel your
limbs begin to thaw in the warm hear of the brightly lit
interior. You welcome the brief respite from the cold.
Ahead of you waits the lord of (city)...

As you enter (shop), golden
glints from the fall sun reflect off
of the many items of interest
scattered about...

(temple) sanctuary is
a place of peace. Only by concentrating
on the world outside yourself can you
hear the vague drumbeat of the autumn
thunderstorm outside.
