<ce>                You enter %cbd, rubbing your hands together
<ce>                to warm them on this bright winter's day. You can
<ce>                hear chanting in the distance...
<--->
<ce>                %cbd sanctuary is as austerely beautiful
<ce>                as the bright winter's day outside. Tendrils of
<ce>                sweet incense rise from the floor as if in
<ce>                greeting...
<--->
<ce>                On a day as cold as it is blindingly bright,
<ce>                it is easy to see why this part of %cbd
<ce>                is called the sanctuary. Far off to the distance,
<ce>                you can hear the clergy at prayer.

<ce>                as you leave the cold, cloudy

<ce>                You walk into %cbd,
<ce>                smelling the sweet incense that rises
<ce>                like a cloud from the sanctuary floor.

<--->
<ce>                Trailing puddles of warm spring rain
<ce>                behind you, you enter %cbd
<ce>                sanctuary. An open window lets the smell
<ce>                of the storm in, overpowering the sweet
<ce>                incense of %cbd itself.
<--->
<ce>                Wiping the warm rain from your shoulders
<ce>                and head, you walk into
<ce>                %cbd sanctuary. Off to

<ce>                You enter %cbd, thankful
<ce>                for the respite from the harsh summer sun.
<ce>                You can hear chanting in the distance...
<--->
<ce>                The stinging of prickly heat is instantly
<ce>                soothed the moment you enter
<ce>                %cbd sanctuary. In the
<ce>                distance, you can hear the low murmur of
<ce>                chanting. This is a place of great
<ce>                tranquillity.
<--->
<ce>                The god who protects %cbd
<ce>                must be great indeed, for it is as bright
<ce>                as the summer day yet comfortable as a
<ce>                shadowy place within. A pleasant floral
<ce>                odor of incense fills the air.

<--->
<ce>                As miserable as the sweltering summer day
<ce>                is, it is at least less eerie than the
<ce>                sterile %cbd sanctuary.
<ce>                No birds or insects can be heard in here,
<ce>                and the air is empty of both smell and
<ce>                temperature. It may be very holy indeed,
<ce>                but you feel like you have stepped into
<ce>                a void.
<--->
<ce>                %cbd sanctuary is a haven
<ce>                for all, a place of self reflection, solitude,
<ce>                and prayer. It is always perfectly mild in
<ce>                here, as hot and cloudy as the day outside may
<ce>                be...

<ce>                prayer.
<--->
<ce>                %cbd sanctuary is
<ce>                a place of peace. Only by concentrating
<ce>                on the world outside yourself can you
<ce>                hear the vague drumbeat of the autumn
<ce>                thunderstorm outside.
<--->
<ce>                You enter %cbd expecting
<ce>                the sweet smell of incense and the calming
<ce>                chant of priests, but only find the screams
<ce>                of the injured and the smell of death. Even
<ce>                the home of the Divines wasn't spared of
<ce>                the effects of war.
