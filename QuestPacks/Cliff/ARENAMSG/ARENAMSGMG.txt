-TEMPERATE
--WINTER (1010)
----SUNNY
Message: 1010
<ce>The sun outside has done little to warm
<ce>your bones, which are now almost frozen.
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild, stamping your
<ce>feet and crowding close to a brazier
<ce>that glows hot with fiery coals. As the
<ce>warmth slowly seeps in, you notice
<ce>arcane implements and mystical apparati.
<ce>You think you feel a strange tingling on
<ce>your skin.
<--->
<ce>As sunny as it was, you felt a winter
<ce>chill outside and now, within the Mages
<ce>Guild, you feel the cold more intensely.
<ce>Dust lies on the shelves of books,
<ce>potions, and relics like an early frost.
<ce>The stone walls of the chamber glisten
<ce>with ice.
<--->
<ce>The melancholy Mages Guild is slightly
<ce>warmer than the winter day outside but,
<ce>without the sunlight, the effect is much
<ce>the same. Many books and arcane
<ce>instruments lie scattered about, but
<ce>they fail to lend any vitality to the
<ce>scene. It is a place of mystical study,
<ce>not built for human comfort.

----CLOUDY/OVERCAST/FOG
Message: 1011
<ce>The gray sky has done little to warm
<ce>your bones, which by now are almost
<ce>frozen. You enter the Mages Guild,
<ce>stamping your feet to increase the
<ce>circulation and crowd close to a
<ce>brazier that glows hot with fiery coals.
<ce>As the warmth slowly seeps in, you
<ce>notice arcane implements and mystical
<ce>apparati. You think you feel a strange
<ce>tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>It is a perfect day for those who
<ce>practice the shadowy arts: the Mages
<ce>Guild comes most alive on cold, dark
<ce>winter days. Cauldrons bubble on the
<ce>fireplace, filling the room with
<ce>translucent smoke that smells of animal
<ce>fat and sulfur. The shelves are
<ce>cluttered with mystical books and
<ce>artifacts...
<--->
<ce>You know that you can only see half of
<ce>what is in the Mages Guild. The titles
<ce>of the books on the shelves seem to
<ce>change depending on the angle you look.
<ce>Invisible fingers run through the dust
<ce>and over your face. From the corner of
<ce>your eye, you can see demons grinning
<ce>at you, but they vanish when you turn to
<ce>look at them. As dark a winter day as it
<ce>is outside, you want to do your business
<ce>here and leave...

----SNOW
Message: 1013
<ce>Snow and wind swirl about you as you
<ce>enter the Mages Guild and shut the door.
<ce>Outside the winter snow falls without
<ce>any signs of stopping. You stamp your
<ce>feet and crowd close to a brazier that
<ce>glows hot with fiery coals. As the warmth
<ce>slowly seeps in, you notice arcane
<ce>implements and mystical apparati. You
<ce>think you feel a strange tingling over
<ce>your skin.
<--->
<ce>The white dust in the Mages Guild is not
<ce>as deep as the snow outside, but it is so
<ce>omnipresent that all the arcane relics
<ce>within seem to be covered in a thin
<ce>shroud. It is an almost soundless chamber,
<ce>with only an occasional sigh from the pot
<ce>of boiling liquid on the fire. Slowly
<ce>warmth creeps back into your chilled body.
<--->
<ce>You enter the dim Mages Guild, warmed by
<ce>a spell that dries the snow from your face
<ce>and hair almost immediately. Books, charms,
<ce>scrolls, and other relics, older than human
<ce>memory, are kept in pristine condition here
<ce>by the same mystic energy.


--SPRING (1020)
----SUNNY
Message: 1020
<ce>A cool breeze follows you into the Mages
<ce>Guild, drying the slight sheen of sweat
<ce>from your brow. The interior smells of
<ce>spices and chemicals. As your eyes
<ce>adjust to the dim light you can make out
<ce>arcane implements and mystical apparati.
<ce>You think you feel a strange tingling on
<ce>your skin.
<--->
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild, the smell of
<ce>sulfur and rotting parchment replacing
<ce>that of new spring blossoms. Scrolls and
<ce>potions, relics and artifacts vie for
<ce>space on the bookshelves. You can hear
<ce>small living things scuttling behind the
<ce>volumes of alien encyclopedia.
<--->
<ce>The mystical energy in the Mages Guild
<ce>runs through you like a charge of
<ce>lightning. Outside nature is in her full
<ce>vernal glory on this sunny day, but she
<ce>has little power in here. From the stone
<ce>walls to the scrolls and potions, the
<ce>most mundane parts of this chamber seem
<ce>like phantasmagoria.

----CLOUDY/OVERCAST/FOG
Message: 1021
<ce>Although the sky is gray the weather
<ce>itself is pleasant. You can smell
<ce>rain in the air, but that quickly
<ce>changes as the door shuts behind you.
<ce>The Mages Guild smells like old
<ce>spices and chemicals. You can make
<ce>out dozens of arcane implements and
<ce>mystical apparati. You think you feel
<ce>a strange tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild from the
<ce>gloomy spring day and are struck by
<ce>the clutter. You know that wizardry
<ce>is a mental art, and it is hard to
<ce>believe the sorcerers behind this
<ce>jumble of items and apparati are not
<ce>either madmen or fools. You can
<ce>definitely hear small living things
<ce>move about in the piles.
<--->
<ce>The Mages Guild is not a place where
<ce>the normal gods of Nature hold reign,
<ce>but on such a bleak spring day, it
<ce>does not look like they have power
<ce>anywhere. Somehow the chamber is
<ce>simultaneously too hot and too cold,
<ce>wet with humidity in one spot, drier
<ce>than the Khajiit desert in another.
<ce>Even the mystical items on the shelves
<ce>are juxtaposed between extremes,
<ce>ancient scrolls next to modern
<ce>measuring devices, this one filthy
<ce>with neglect, that polished with care.

----RAIN
Message: 1022
<ce>You shake the warm rain from your
<ce>shoulders, conscious of the pooling
<ce>water at your feet. As your eyes
<ce>slowly adjust to the dim interior,
<ce>you can make out arcane implements
<ce>and mystical apparati. You think you
<ce>feel a strange tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>As thick as the stone walls of the
<ce>Mages guild are, you can hear
<ce>virtually every splatter of the spring
<ce>rain outside. You are almost afraid to
<ce>talk, for every echo of each footstep
<ce>causes great clouds of dust to billow.
<ce>And there are books and apparati in
<ce>this room, you suspect, that should
<ce>never be disturbed.
<--->
<ce>An open window in the Mages Guild lets
<ce>in the smell of the spring storm, which
<ce>mingles with the chemical stench that
<ce>bubbles from an open cauldron. The
<ce>chamber is filled with arcane objects,
<ce>jugs, cloaks, scrolls, amulets, tomes,
<ce>brooches, potions, robes, figurines,
<ce>talismans.


--SUMMER (1030)
----SUNNY
Message: 1030
<ce>You wipe the sweat off your brow as you
<ce>enter the Mages Guild. The cool shade
<ce>of the interior is a welcomed sight
<ce>after standing under the harsh summer
<ce>sun. Around you are arcane implements
<ce>and mystical apparati. You feel a slight
<ce>tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>For a moment after leaving the bright
<ce>summer sunshine, your eyes register only
<ce>darkness in the gloomy Mages Guild. When
<ce>they adjust, you can understand very
<ce>little of what you see. Tomes of
<ce>antiquated wizardry and obscure objects
<ce>crowd the dusty shelves.
<--->
<ce>The door to the Mages Guild opens with a
<ce>puff of dust that sticks to the sweat on
<ce>your sunburned face. The smells of
<ce>sulfurous potions burning and ancient
<ce>scrolls of moldering parchment sting your
<ce>nose. At least it is cool in here, you
<ce>say to yourself.

----CLOUDY/OVERCAST/FOG
Message: 1031
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild, its gloomy
<ce>interior not much different from the
<ce>iron-gray, overcast sky outside. At
<ce>least, you silently think, the sun
<ce>isn't out. Around you are arcane
<ce>implements and mystical apparati. You
<ce>feel a slight tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>All the humidity and heat of the day
<ce>are intensified in the Mages Guild.
<ce>To add to the infernal atmosphere,
<ce>tendrils of soot-filled smoke and the
<ce>whimpers from some doomed experiment
<ce>slip through the cracks of locked
<ce>doors. Each book on the shelf looks
<ce>like it is watching you.
<--->
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild, an
<ce>amalgamation of primordial relics,
<ce>moldering scrolls, dripping unguents,
<ce>and smoking fluids. An occasional
<ce>groan or minor explosion can be heard
<ce>coming from the laboratories. At least
<ce>it's not as hot and humid as outside.

----RAIN
Message: 1032
<ce>You shake the rain from your shoulders
<ce>as you enter the Mages Guild. The dry
<ce>interior is a welcomed sight after
<ce>standing in the downpour outside.
<ce>Around you are arcane implements and
<ce>mystical apparati. You feel a slight
<ce>tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>The sound of the warm summer rain is
<ce>muffled by the thick walls and
<ce>thicker velvet curtains. This is a
<ce>place where the outside world is a
<ce>distraction to be avoided. The smells,
<ce>sights, and sounds here are unique to
<ce>the field of mystical experimentation.
<--->
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild, avoiding
<ce>the puddles of rainwater leaking under
<ce>the door. The room is damp, but the
<ce>thick stone walls keep it cool even in
<ce>the dog days of summer. Strange devices
<ce>and venerable tomes crowd across the
<ce>dust and soot streaked shelves.


--FALL (1040)
----SUNNY
Message: 1040
<ce>Behind you the fall sun sheds warmth
<ce>upon the land, holding back the icy
<ce>fingers of winter yet another day.
<ce>Around you are arcane implements and
<ce>mystical apparati. You feel a strange
<ce>tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>While the local farmers have been
<ce>gathering their crops, it would
<ce>appear the mages have been collecting
<ce>a harvest of their own. The Mages
<ce>Guild is crowded with scrolls, relics,
<ce>charms, and artifacts. Clearly some
<ce>extensive trading between one town's
<ce>guild to another's has been going on
<ce>this fall.
<--->
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild, a world
<ce>where nature holds little power.
<ce>Outside leaves are falling and plants
<ce>are dying back into the ground, but
<ce>in here, strange flora lives year
<ce>round, competing for space next to
<ce>the scrolls, potions, and other
<ce>mystic apparati that crowds the
<ce>Guild's shelves.

----CLOUDY/OVERCAST/FOG
Message: 1041
<ce>You enter the Mage's Guild, its
<ce>gloomy interior not much different
<ce>from the cold, overcast sky
<ce>outside. At least, you silently
<ce>thank, the interior is warm. You
<ce>rub your hands together to bring
<ce>back some feeling. Around you are
<ce>arcane implements and mystical
<ce>apparati. You feel a strange
<ce>tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>On a dark cool day like today,
<ce>those who devote their lives to
<ce>the mystical sciences are at
<ce>their busiest. Outside, people
<ce>look into the sky and view the
<ce>coming winter with dread. All in
<ce>the Mages Guild are as ctive with
<ce>mystic energy as they might be on
<ce>any day, including the books and
<ce>relics that line the shelves.
<--->
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild, going from
<ce>a cool gloomy outside to a cool
<ce>gloomy inside. Because of the shadows,
<ce>you cannot see all that the chamber
<ce>contains. You suspect that even by the
<ce>light of a bright day, the room has
<ce>its secrets. Potions, relics, and books
<ce>line the bookshelves shrouded by a fine
<ce>dust.

----RAIN
Message: 1042
<ce>You shake the cold rain from your
<ce>shoulders as you enter the Mages
<ce>Guild, stamping your feet to bring
<ce>back some warmth. The dry interior
<ce>is a welcomed sight after standing
<ce>in the icy downpour outside.
<ce>Around you are arcane implements
<ce>and mystical apparati. You feel a
<ce>slight tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>The Mages Guild is dry, but no
<ce>more welcome that the cold autumn
<ce>tempest outside. Strange and
<ce>exotic potions, ancient scrolls,
<ce>and arcane relics look down at
<ce>you from the shelves as if they
<ce>are predatory birds, watching for
<ce>you to make a mistake. The dark
<ce>energy in the room goes through
<ce>you like a charge.
<--->
<ce>All along the walls of the Mages
<ce>Guild, blackened with soot and
<ce>neglect, are shelves of books and
<ce>arcane apparati so cloaked in
<ce>dust to be practically
<ce>indistinguishable one from the
<ce>other. You can hear the sound of
<ce>the fall cloudburst outside,
<ce>uncomfortably loud in the normally
<ce>still little room.

<ce>a harvest of their own. The Mages
<ce>Guild is crowded with scrolls, relics,
<ce>charms, and artifacts. Clearly some
<ce>extensive trading between one town's
<ce>guild to another's has been going on
<ce>this fall.
<--->
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild, a world
<ce>where nature holds little power.
<ce>Outside the sun beats the land with
<ce>heat, searing it clean. In here
<ce>however, strange flora lives year
<ce>round, competing for space next to
<ce>the scrolls, potions, and other
<ce>mystic apparati that crowds the
<ce>Guild's shelves.

----CLOUDY/OVERCAST/FOG
Message: 1341
<ce>You enter the Mage's Guild, its
<ce>gloomy interior not much different
<ce>from the chilly, overcast sky
<ce>outside. At least, you silently
<ce>thank, the interior is warm. You
<ce>rub your hands together to bring
<ce>back some feeling. Around you are
<ce>arcane implements and mystical
<ce>apparati. You feel a strange
<ce>tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>On a dark cool day like today,
<ce>those who devote their lives to
<ce>the mystical sciences are at
<ce>their busiest. Outside, people
<ce>look into the sky and view the
<ce>coming winter with dread. All in
<ce>the Mages Guild are as ctive with
<ce>mystic energy as they might be on
<ce>any day, including the books and
<ce>relics that line the shelves.
<--->
<ce>You enter the Mages Guild, going from
<ce>a cool gloomy outside to a cool
<ce>gloomy inside. Because of the shadows,
<ce>you cannot see all that the chamber
<ce>contains. You suspect that even by the
<ce>light of a bright day, the room has
<ce>its secrets. Potions, relics, and books
<ce>line the bookshelves shrouded by a fine
<ce>dust.

----RAIN
Message: 1342
<ce>You shake the hot rain from your
<ce>shoulders as you enter the Mages
<ce>Guild, stamping your feet to bring
<ce>back some warmth. The dry interior
<ce>is a welcomed sight after standing
<ce>in the uncommon downpour outside.
<ce>Around you are arcane implements
<ce>and mystical apparati. You feel a
<ce>slight tingling on your skin.
<--->
<ce>The Mages Guild is dry, but no
<ce>more welcome that the hot autumn
<ce>tempest outside. Strange and
<ce>exotic potions, ancient scrolls,
<ce>and arcane relics look down at
<ce>you from the shelves as if they
<ce>are predatory birds, watching for
<ce>you to make a mistake. The dark
<ce>energy in the room goes through
<ce>you like a charge.
<--->
<ce>All along the walls of the Mages
<ce>Guild, blackened with soot and
<ce>neglect, are shelves of books and
<ce>arcane apparati so cloaked in
<ce>dust to be practically
<ce>indistinguishable one from the
<ce>other. You can hear the sound of
<ce>the downpour outside,
<ce>uncomfortably loud in the normally
<ce>still little room.
