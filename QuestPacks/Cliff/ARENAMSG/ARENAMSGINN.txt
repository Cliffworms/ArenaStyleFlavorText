<--->
<ce>The townsmen have met in
<ce>%cbd to celebrate a good
<ce>fall harvest. Their exuberance is
<ce>infectious. Oh great, you say to
<ce>yourself, I'll probably have this
<ce>stupid drinking song in my head
<ce>all day...

----CLOUDY/OVERCAST/FOG*
Message: 1241
<ce>The tavern you enter is brightly
<ce>lit and colorful, compared to the
<ce>cold, dark clouds that hang in
<ce>the sky...
<--->
<ce>You walk out of the cloudy autumn
<ce>day into %cbd,
<ce>the smell of baking bread pulling
<ce>on you like a lure...
<--->
<ce>On an overcast autumn day like
<ce>today, %cbd is very
<ce>popular and you can see why. It
<ce>certainly lifts the spirits...

----RAIN*
Message: 1242
<ce>You enter %cbd
<ce>and shake the cold rain from
<ce>your shoulders, hoping for a
<ce>fire of some sort to dry
<ce>yourself...
<--->
<ce>Cold winds and rain follow you
<ce>into %cbd like
<ce>a beggar. You wipe your wet
<ce>shoulders and head as you head
<ce>for the fireplace...
<--->
<ce>Shivering from the freezing autumn
<ce>tempest, you escape into
<ce>%cbd. Other miserably
<ce>wet people have gathered in
<ce>dripping groups...

----NIGHT*
Message: 1244
<ce>You enter %cbd, rubbing the
<ce>cold night air from your bones. The
<ce>tavern is full of people bustling
<ce>here and there...
<--->
<ce>On this cold autumn night,
<ce>%cbd seems especially
<ce>inviting. You smell apples baking
<ce>in the kitchen and look forward
<ce>to your first draught of ale...
<--->
<ce>The warm smells of tobacco smoke
<ce>and simple foods draw you into
<ce>%cbd from the
<ce>cold autumn night...
