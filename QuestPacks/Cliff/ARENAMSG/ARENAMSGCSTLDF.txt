--WINTER (1010)
----SUNNY
Message: 1010
<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing
<ce>                the many fine trappings and warm furs that decorate
<ce>                the area. Even though the sun outside is strong,
<ce>                winter's hand has chilled you to the bone. You find
<ce>                that you welcome the brightly lit and warm interior.
<ce>                Ahead of you waits %rn, %rt of %cn...
<--->
<ce>                You enter the audience chamber of %rn of
<ce>                %cn, your lips chapped from the cold
<ce>                and your flesh scorched by the sun. Representatives
<ce>                from Sentinel, who were meeting with the %rt,
<ce>                leave the room as you enter. It appears things have
<ce>                not gone well, for the Council of Elders and the
<ce>                %rt seem to be in a sour mood...

<ce>                You enter the audience chamber of %rn of
<ce>                %cn, your lips chapped from the cold
<ce>                and your flesh scorched by the sun. Representatives
<ce>                from Wayrest, who were meeting with the %rt,
<ce>                leave the room as you enter. It appears things have
<ce>                gone well, for the Council of Elders and the
<ce>                %rt seem to be in a good mood...
<--->
<ce>                %rn's audience chamber is alive with excitement.
<ce>                %cn and representatives of ___city_,
<ce>                its neighbor to the %di, are at business talks.
<ce>                Naturally, this has caused a lot of the internal
<ce>                stress within %cn. The %rt is remarkably calm,
<ce>                hearing each of the citizen's concerns about trade
<ce>                and commerce...

<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing
<ce>                the many fine trappings and warm furs that decorate
<ce>                the area. The freezing temperature and iron gray
<ce>                clouds outside have made everything frozen and dull,
<ce>                though you find that the interior of this chamber is
<ce>                brightly lit and cheerful. Ahead of you waits %rn,
<ce>                %rt of %cn...
<--->
<ce>                Frozen to the core, you stumble into the audience
<ce>                chamber of %rn, %rt of %cn, only to feel a chill
<ce>                that pierces your soul. The room itself is
<ce>                physically warm and pleasing to the eye, but you
<ce>                sense an undercurrent of tension...
<--->
<ce>                You are admitted into the presence of the good %rt
<ce>                of %cn, %rn. A thick cloak of wolf hide is
<ce>                gently wrapped around your shoulders, and as feeling
<ce>                returns to your skin, you feel that parts of your
<ce>                face were dangerously close to frostbite...

<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                many fine trappings and warm furs that decorate the area.
<ce>                You feel your frozen limbs begin to thaw in the warm heat
<ce>                of the brightly lit interior. You welcome the brief
<ce>                respite from the cold. Ahead of you waits the %rt
<ce>                of %cn...
<--->
<ce>                The audience chamber of %rn is drier than the snowy
<ce>                streets of %cn, but not any warmer. You
<ce>                rub your hands together and watch your breath
<ce>                come like smoke from a chimney...
<--->
<ce>                Your eyes, squinting from the glare of the snow outside,
<ce>                grow accustomed to the gloom of %rn's audience chamber.


--SPRING (1020)
----SUNNY
Message: 1020
<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                many fine trappings and expensive furniture that
<ce>                decorate the area. The warm spring air wafts through an
<ce>                open window, bringing along with it the scent of newly
<ce>                budding flowers and fresh green grass.
<--->
<ce>                It is hard to believe that anyone can think of politics
<ce>                on such a day, but people are lining up to be heard by
<ce>                the %rt of %cn while outside newly bloomed
<ce>                flowers perfume the air...
<--->
<ce>                Inside the audience chamber of the %rt of %cn,
<ce>                the new sprouts of spring die young and the perfume of
<ce>                the fresh blossom turns to a sickly stench. %rn is
<ce>                rumored to have angered the city oracle who placed upon
<ce>                him a curse of poor health. The political change has
<ce>                been very noticeable in such a city where tradition is
<ce>                of highest importance...

<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                many fine trappings and expensive furniture that
<ce>                decorate the area. The day has been overcast, iron gray
<ce>                clouds that hint of a spring storm. You find yourself
<ce>                welcoming the sun's return. Ahead of you waits the %rt
<ce>                of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                The government of %cn is like the weather outside,
<ce>                pleasantly temperate but dark with clouds threatening
<ce>                catastrophe. In %rn's audience chamber no one even whispers
<ce>                their theories about the ulterior motives behind the region's
<ce>                recent deal with its neighbor, Shalgora.
<--->
<ce>                You like the looks of %rn's audience chamber the moment you
<ce>                enter. Beautiful music rings through the room and the walls
<ce>                hang with rich tapestries of spring scenes much nicer than
<ce>                the gray day outside...

----RAIN
Message: 1022
<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                many fine trappings and expensive furniture that
<ce>                decorate the area. The warm spring shower has left you
<ce>                pleasantly refreshed, if a bit wet, but a breeze seems
<ce>                to be blowing through here and you feel yourself dry
<ce>                quickly...
<--->
<ce>                For an agriculture-based city like %cn,
<ce>                a good spring rain makes all the difference during the
<ce>                seeding. Everyone seems in a good mood, and the
<ce>                preparations for the traditional new year celebrations
<ce>                is the conversation on all lips...
<--->
<ce>                Through an open window in %rn's audience chamber, you can
<ce>                smell the spring rain and newly blossomed flowers out
<ce>                in the streets of %cn. The floor is wet with the tread
<ce>                of many visitors...


--SUMMER (1030)
----SUNNY
Message: 1030
<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                fine trappings and furniture that decorate the area. A
<ce>                cool breeze wafts through the area, drying the sweat
<ce>                from your body and bringing a welcomed sigh to your lips.
<ce>                You relish in the brief respite. Ahead of you waits the
<ce>                %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                Outside the sun batters relentlessly on the citizens of
<ce>                %cn, but in %rn's audience chamber, the
<ce>                shadows are deliverance. The rewards of power and wealth
<ce>                decorate the room. Obviously, trading with the his
<ce>                neighbors has been profitable for the %rt of
<ce>                %cn. Perhaps you too can benefit from this situation...
<--->
<ce>                You enter %rn's audience chamber. Despite the
<ce>                season, not a warm ray of sunshine has touched this room.
<ce>                You breath in the musty air and wipe the sweat from your
<ce>                brow as you wait for the %rt to finish business with
<ce>                some messengers from Glenpoint. The behavior between
<ce>                the %rt and the messengers is peculiar, considering the
<ce>                two have been at peace for some time...

<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                fine trappings and furniture that decorate the area.
<ce>                Even though the clouds outside have made everything seem
<ce>                dull and gray, you find that the interior is brightly
<ce>                lit and cheerful. Ahead of you waits the %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                You enter the audience chamber, finding the city elders
<ce>                in conference with their %rt. The mood in the room
<ce>                reflects the weather outside; hot and dark with rain
<ce>                clouds. The elders continue to whisper nervously one to
<ce>                the other.
<--->
<ce>                The audience chamber of %rn is alive with activity.
<ce>                The %rt and an elder discuss a discontented local group
<ce>                who wish %cn to stop trading with Tulune.
<ce>                He next turns his attention to a merchant whose shop is
<ce>                under suspicion of housing a Thieves' Guild's hideout...

<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                fine trappings and furniture that decorate the area.
<ce>                Outside you can still hear the raindrops as they fall,
<ce>                soaking everything in sight and creating a humid haze
<ce>                which causes your clothes to cling to you like a second
<ce>                skin. Ahead of you waits the %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                You enter the audience chamber, wiping the warm water of
<ce>                the summer rain off of your face. At the center of the
<ce>                opulently decorated room, the %rt is speaking with the
<ce>                city councilmen of %cn. You overhear them mention
<ce>                __city_, their neighbor to the %di.
<--->
<ce>                Like an unwanted dog, the steam from the hot summer
<ce>                drizzle has followed you to the audience chamber of
<ce>                %rn. They whisper, but you think you hear
<ce>                one of the counselors remind the %rt that they
<ce>                have a trade deal with Ilessan Hills, the region's
<ce>                neighbor to the north.


--FALL (1040)
----SUNNY
Message: 1040
<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                many fine trappings and furniture that decorate the
<ce>                area. Outside the golden fall sun lends its warmth,
<ce>                holding back winter's hand for a few moments more. Ahead
<ce>                of you waits the %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                It is the busiest season of the year in %cn, and
<ce>                the palace's audience chamber is filled with area farmers
<ce>                discussing their harvests with their %rt. Many linger
<ce>                in the room after their business is through,
<ce>                procrastinating the return to the burning field work.
<ce>                They seem to be talking mostly about %reg being
<ce>                suddenly at peace with its nearest neighbor, and how this
<ce>                will change the trade throughout the region.
<--->
<ce>                It is unusually warm for the autumn in %cn,
<ce>                but %rn's audience chamber reflects little of the
<ce>                sunshine outside...

<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                many fine trappings and furs that decorate the area.
<ce>                Even though autumn's clouds outside have made
<ce>                everything seem cold and gray, you find that the
<ce>                interior is brightly lit and warm. Ahead of you waits
<ce>                the %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                You enter the audience chamber, shaking the chill of the
<ce>                gray autumn day from your skin. Being currently trade
<ce>                partners with its neighbor on the other side of the Iliac
<ce>                Bay, Sentinel, the leading citizens of %cn
<ce>                have met to discuss the resultant implications with their
<ce>                %rt...
<--->
<ce>                As you enter the audience chamber of the %rt of %cn,
<ce>                you feel the autumn chill from the outside is actually
<ce>                intensified within. The thick furs and darkly beautiful
<ce>                ornaments that decorate the walls make you feel as if
<ce>                you're being watched. The %rt looks up from the
<ce>                conference he is having with the Council of Elders...

----RAIN
Message: 1042
<ce>                You walk into %rn's audience chamber shaking the
<ce>                cold rain from your shoulders. The first thing you
<ce>                notice is the many fine trappings and furniture that
<ce>                decorate the area. The warm air serves to quickly dry
<ce>                you from the fall shower outside. Ahead of you waits
<ce>                the %rt of %cn...
<--->
<ce>                You had hoped that the chamber of the %rt of %cn
<ce>                would provide relief from the cold autumn rain outside,
<ce>                but it is as damp and chilly as a mausoleum. Others
<ce>                seeking audience wait with dripping hair and chattering
<ce>                teeth, as the %rt talks with a representative from
<ce>                Anticlere, the region's neighbor to the east that
<ce>                %cn is trading with...
<--->
<ce>                It has been an uncomfortably warm autumn in the city
<ce>                of %cn, so the recent shower has actually improved
<ce>                the mood in the audience chamber of its %rt. You
<ce>                know that Shalgora, %cn's temperamental neighbor,
<ce>                has only recently signed a trade deal with %cn,
<ce>                but foreign diplomacy is not being discussed among
<ce>                the %rt and the circle of counselors.
