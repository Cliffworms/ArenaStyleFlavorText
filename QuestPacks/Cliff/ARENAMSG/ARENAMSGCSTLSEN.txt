<ce>                You walk into the %rt's audience chamber, noticing
<ce>                the many fine trappings and furniture that decorate
<ce>                the area. Even though the sun outside is bright and
<ce>                strong, this season's slightly colder temperatures
<ce>                have chilled your skin. You find that you welcome
<ce>                the well lit and warm interior. Somewhere within
<ce>                waits %rn, %rt of %cn...
<--->
<ce>                You enter %rn's audience chamber, your flesh
<ce>                scorched by the sun. Representatives from
<ce>                Daggerfall, which were meeting with the
<ce>                %rt, leave the room as you enter. It appears
<ce>                things have not gone well, for the Council of
<ce>                Elders and the %rt seem to be in a sour mood...

<--->
<ce>                The %rt's audience chamber is alive with excitement.
<ce>                %cn and representatives of the Ayasofya,
<ce>                its neighbor to the east, are at business talks.
<ce>                Naturally, this has caused a lot of the internal
<ce>                stress within %cn. The %rt is remarkably calm,
<ce>                hearing each of the citizen's concerns about trade
<ce>                and commerce...

<ce>                You walk into the %rt's audience chamber, noticing
<ce>                the many fine trappings and furniture that decorate
<ce>                the area. The chilling temperature and iron gray
<ce>                clouds outside have made everything dull, though
<ce>                you find that the interior of this chamber is
<ce>                brightly lit and cheerful. Somewhere within waits
<ce>                %rt of %cn...
<--->
<ce>                Chilled by the cool air outside, you stumble into
<ce>                %rn's audience chamber, only to feel a colder
<ce>                chill that pierces your soul. The room itself is
<ce>                physically warm and pleasing to the eye, but you
<ce>                sense an undercurrent of tension...
<--->
<ce>                You like the looks of the audience chamber the moment you
<ce>                enter. Beautiful music rings through the room and the walls
<ce>                hang with rich tapestries of desert scenes much nicer than
<ce>                the gray day outside...

<ce>                many fine trappings and expensive furniture that
<ce>                decorate the area. The cool shower has left you
<ce>                pleasantly refreshed, if a bit cold, but a breeze seems
<ce>                to be blowing through here and you feel yourself dry
<ce>                quickly...
<--->
<ce>                For a desert city like %cn, rain showers makes all the
<ce>                difference. Everyone seems in a good mood, and the
<ce>                preparations for the traditional new year
<ce>                celebrations is the conversation on all lips...
<--->
<ce>                Through an open window in the audience chamber, you can
<ce>                smell the rain in the streets of %cn. The floor
<ce>                is wet with the tread of many visitors...


--SPRING (1120)

Message: 1120
<ce>                You walk into the %rt's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                many fine trappings and expensive furniture that
<ce>                decorate the area. The warm spring air wafts through an
<ce>                open window, bringing along with it the scent of newly
<ce>                blooming cacti, and fresh flowers.
<--->
<ce>                It is hard to believe that anyone can think of politics
<ce>                on such a day, but people are lining up to be heard by
<ce>                the %rt of %cn while outside newly bloomed
<ce>                flowers perfume the air...
<--->
<ce>                Inside the audience chamber of the %rt of %cn,
<ce>                the new sprouts of spring die young and the perfume of
<ce>                the fresh blossom turns to a sickly stench. %rn is
<ce>                rumored to have angered the city oracle who placed upon
<ce>                her a curse of poor health. The political change has
<ce>                been very noticeable in such a city where tradition is
<ce>                of highest importance...

<ce>                many fine trappings and expensive furniture that
<ce>                decorate the area. The day has been overcast, iron gray
<ce>                clouds that hint of a spring storm. You find yourself
<ce>                welcoming the sun's return. Somewhere within waits the %rt
<ce>                of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                The government of %cn is like the weather outside,
<ce>                hot and unforgiving. In the audience chamber no one even
<ce>                whispers their theories about the ulterior motives behind
<ce>                the city's recent deal with its neighbor, Antiphyllos.
<--->
<ce>                You like the looks of the audience chamber the moment you

<ce>                the hot, gray day outside...

--SUMMER (1130)

Message: 1130
<ce>                You walk into the %rt's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                fine trappings and furniture that decorate the area. A
<ce>                hot breeze wafts through the area, drying the sweat from
<ce>                your body and bringing an unpleasant sigh to your lips.
<ce>                You relish at the idea of a brief respite. Somewhere
<ce>                within waits the %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                Outside the sun batters relentlessly on the citizens of
<ce>                %cn, but in %rn's audience chamber, the
<ce>                shadows are deliverance. The rewards of power and wealth
<ce>                decorate the room. Obviously, trading with her neighbor
<ce>                has been profitable for the %rt of %cn.
<ce>                Perhaps you too can benefit from this situation...
<--->
<ce>                You enter %rn's audience chamber. Despite the
<ce>                season, not a ray of sunshine has touched this room.
<ce>                You breath in the musty air and wipe the sweat from your
<ce>                brow as you wait for the %rt to finish business with
<ce>                some messengers from Pothago. The behavior between
<ce>                the %rt and the messengers is peculiar, considering the
<ce>                two have been at peace for some time...

<ce>                Even though the clouds outside have made everything seem

<ce>                lit and cheerful. Ahead of you waits the %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                You enter the audience chamber, finding the city elders
<ce>                in conference with their %rt. The mood in the room
<ce>                reflects the weather outside; hot and dark with rain
<ce>                clouds. The elders continue to whisper nervously one to
<ce>                the other.
<--->
<ce>                %rn's audience chamber is alive with activity.
<ce>                The %rt and an elder discuss a discontented local group
<ce>                who wish %cn to stop trading with Tigonus.
<ce>                She next turns her attention to a merchant whose shop is
<ce>                under suspicion of housing a Thieves' Guild's hideout...

<ce>                You walk into the %rt's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                fine trappings and furniture that decorate the area.
<ce>                Outside you can still hear the raindrops as they fall,
<ce>                soaking everything in sight and creating a humid haze
<ce>                which causes your clothes to cling to you like a second
<ce>                skin. Somewhere within waits the %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                You enter the audience chamber, wiping the warm sweat of
<ce>                summer off of your face. At the center of the opulently
<ce>                decorated room, the %rt is speaking with the city
<ce>                councilmen of %cn. You overhear them mention
<ce>                __city_, their neighbor to the %di.
<--->
<ce>                Like an unwanted dog, the dry heat from the hot
<ce>                summer has followed you to the audience chamber
<ce>                of %cn's %rt. They whisper, but you think you
<ce>                hear one of the counselors remind the %rt that
<ce>                they have a trade deal with __city_,
<ce>                the city's neighbor to the %di.


--FALL (1140)

<ce>                You walk into the %rt's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                many fine trappings and furniture that decorate the
<ce>                area. Outside the golden fall sun lends its heat to the
<ce>                interior. Ahead of you waits the %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                It is the busiest season of the year in %cn, and
<ce>                the palace's audience chamber is filled with area farmers
<ce>                discussing their harvests with their %rt. Many linger
<ce>                in the room after their business is through,
<ce>                procrastinating the return to the burning field work.
<ce>                They seem to be talking mostly about %reg being
<ce>                suddenly at peace with its nearest neighbor, and how this
<ce>                will change the trade throughout the region.
<--->
<ce>                It is unusually hot for the autumn in %cn,
<ce>                but the audience chamber reflects little of the
<ce>                sunshine outside...

<ce>                You walk into the %rt's audience chamber, noticing the
<ce>                many fine trappings and furs that decorate the area.
<ce>                Even though autumn's clouds outside have made
<ce>                everything seem dark and gray, you find that the
<ce>                interior is brightly lit and warm. Somewhere within
<ce>                waits the %rt of %cn.
<--->
<ce>                You enter the audience chamber, shaking the heat of the
<ce>                gray autumn day from your skin. Being currently trade
<ce>                partners with its neighbor to the west, Myrkwasa, the
<ce>                leading citizens of %cn have met to discuss the resultant
<ce>                implications with their %rt...
<--->
<ce>                As you enter the audience chamber of the %rt of %cn,
<ce>                you feel the autumn heat from the outside is actually
<ce>                intensified within. The thick furs and darkly beautiful
<ce>                ornaments that decorate the walls make you feel as if
<ce>                you're being watched. The %rt looks up from the
<ce>                conference she is having with the Council of Elders...

<ce>                You walk into the %rt's audience chamber shaking the
<ce>                hot rain from your shoulders. The first thing you
<ce>                notice is the many fine trappings and furniture that
<ce>                decorate the area. The desert air serves to quickly dry
<ce>                you from the fall shower outside. Somewhere within
<ce>                waits the %rt of %cn...
<--->
<ce>                You had hoped that %rn's chamber would provide
<ce>                relief from the hot autumn rain outside, but it is as
<ce>                damp and chilly as a mausoleum. Others seeking
<ce>                audience wait with dripping hair and chattering
<ce>                teeth, as the %rt talks with a representative from
<ce>                the Alik'r Desert, her neighbor to the south that
<ce>                %cn is trading with...
<--->
<ce>                It has been an uncomfortably hot autumn in the city
<ce>                of %cn, so the recent shower has actually improved
<ce>                the mood in the audience chamber of its %rt. You
<ce>                know that Ayasofya, %cn's temperamental neighbor,
<ce>                has only recently signed a trade deal with %cn,
<ce>                but foreign diplomacy is not being discussed among
<ce>                the %rt and the circle of counselors.
